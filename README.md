# WebSearchEngine
The assignment is creating a Web search engine that incorporates concepts from three to five different classes. Individual or group projects can be developed, however group work is encouraged. In the case of group work, each group member will receive an individual grade. Students are encouraged to submit their own suggestions for things that should be included in the Web search engine. Finding patterns using regular expressions, converting HTML to text, ranking web pages using sorting, heaps, or other data structures, finding keywords using string matching, using inverted index, analysing frequencies using hash tables or search trees, using large dictionaries/datasets, sorting techniques, search trees, spellchecking keywords or HTML files, and so on are just a few examples. Some concepts were discussed in class, while others were included in the assignments (as optional work). It's worth noting that a graphical user interface for your search engine isn't needed, even if you want to use one.
